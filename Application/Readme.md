# Terje Course



This course teaches low maintenance care of indoor house plants in an apartment with limited natural light.

Goals for our indoor garden
- Effortless
- Visually appealing
- Never be afraid to move a plant, unless maybe the Ficus Lyrata.moved

## Problem
I have a tendency to go all in when something catches my interest. So if I buy a plant, 
then I buy another, and suddenly I have 30 different plants. 

This is a lot of work if you try to care for each plant on it's own.This is also why you respect the plant passport.

## This is where I fail
Then I start adding some kind of light. Then I make a new light from a soda can or something. 
This goes on until everything looks stupid.

Each of them with different needs in regards to light, temperature, humidity and root zone media.


This can be avoided by adhering to the following rules
If you dont want to appear like a total nutjub
- Do not add extra lights. Or is it okay december, january and february?
- Don't add to many plants




## Rules
The goal is to have a lot of plants, which are watered on water day. 
No plant should have a larger container than necessary.


- No grow lights allowed.



If you have spent too much time under covid rule, and joined the plant world, and have a need to purchase every new plant you come across, then yes.



The first, and most important, thing you do for your plant, is giving it the soil it needs.
Then second is location.
Don't stress your plants, find a place where it will survive without elaborate measures like adding lights. You don't really want your plants to grow too much. You want them healthy and thriving.
    /// Important to register the substrate for each plant.
    /// Some plants grow, some don't, so repot and change the substrate until it thrives.
    /// This is valuable information over time.
    /// It will also allow you to know where that fungi came from.
    /// It will help you make your own judgement about which soil is the best.
    /// It will make you embarrased when you realize that all you need is the soil you buy.
    /// It will teach you about different types of soil.
    /// It will teach you what soil is, and why it is soil.
    /// It will teach you what the perched water table is, and why container size matters.
